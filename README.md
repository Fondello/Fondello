👋 Hello! I'm Victor Fondello, a Technology Information student with a passion for software development. My journey has led me to explore JavaScript, C#, and Python, and I'm constantly striving to enhance my skills in backend development.

Beyond the realm of technology, my hobbies include hitting the gym to maintain a healthy balance, diving into virtual worlds through video games, and getting lost in music, which is an essential part of my life.

Let's collaborate and create amazing things together! 👨‍💻🎮🎵
