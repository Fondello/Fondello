👋 Hey everyone! I'm Victor Fondello, and I'm here to share a bit of my journey as a backend programming student, focused on the incredible world of C#. But there's something you need to know: my passion for programming has a story tied to games!
🎮 For as long as I can remember, games have always been a part of my life. And it wasn't just about fun—it was about inspiration. Those virtual worlds, amazing mechanics, captivating stories, they all left me in awe. And I wanted to know how all of that was created!
🚀 So, I decided to dive into programming. I wanted to understand how every line of code built those worlds that fascinated me. And you know what? The passion for games guided me on this journey to learn how to create, build, and innovate in the digital realm.
🥁 Oh, and for those who don't know, I'm also a drummer, passionate about music. Playing drums and coding, for me, are two incredible ways to express my creativity.
💡 So, join me in exploring the C# universe, where each line of code is like a new game level waiting to be conquered. Together, let's create and bring to life our own technological adventures! 💻🎮🎶
